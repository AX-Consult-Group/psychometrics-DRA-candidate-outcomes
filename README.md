# Psychometrics – Candidate Outcomes Analysis (Public Demo)

This repository contains a public example of an analysis evaluating the **predictive validity** of a psychometric risk assessment (DRA) for recruitment. 

### Methods
-   **Descriptive statistics** and visual comparisons of risk scores across outcome categories
-   **SMOTE** oversampling to address class imbalance in predictive modelling
-   **ROC curves** to assess discrimination ability
-   **Random forest** modelling for classification and predictor importance

### Important notes
- **All data is fully synthetic** — generated to match realistic distributions, correlations, and broad patterns from the original analysis. No real individual, candidate, or client data is included.
- **Dimension names** have been generalised or renamed to protect intellectual property. The underlying constructs and relationships remain representative.
- Minor differences in subgroup averages or model performance compared to the original analysis are expected due to simulation noise.
